                "All the ends of the earth shall remember<br>
                and turn to the Lord,<br>
                and all the families of the nations<br>
                shall worship before you."<br>

                Japan is one of the <span class="highlight">most unreached people groups</span> in the entire world. Less than <span class="highlight">0.5% of the population is Christian</span>. In a nation of <span class="highlight">125 million people</span>, roughly <span class="highlight">95% have never heard the Gospel</span>. This, then, is surely a <span class="highlight">field ripe for the harvest</span> (Matthew 9:38).

            <p>
                Located in the <span class="highlight">Aichi prefecture</span> (or region), often referred to as the <span class="highlight">heart of Japan</span>, Nagoya is Japan's <span class="highlight">fourth largest city</span> with a population of <span class="highlight">2.3 million</span>. Nagoya is known as the center of both <span class="highlight">samurai culture</span> and the <span class="highlight">automotive industry</span>. The Aichi prefecture has <span class="highlight">more Buddhist and Shinto temples</span> than any other area in Japan, and just <span class="highlight">one church for every 28,500 people</span>.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Mission to the World</span> has planted <span class="highlight">five churches</span> in Nagoya and started several ministries that engage and serve the people of the city. Many of our missionaries dedicate their <span class="highlight">entire lives</span> to loving the people and preaching the Gospel in <span class="highlight">word and deed</span>.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                In 2020, Mission to the World's Nagoya church planting team launched a school with the goal of <span class="highlight">supporting missionary and other Christian families</span> in the area. <span class="highlight">Nagoya Christian School</span>, or NCS, provides a place for missionary children to learn in their native language, while learning skills (such as Japanese) to <span class="highlight">engage with the culture they live in</span>, and a home for <span class="highlight">Christian fellowship and growth</span>. The staff is made up of trained missionaries, Japanese teachers, and volunteers.

            <p>
                Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Margaret Rodgers</span>, an intern with <span class="highlight">Mission to the World</span>. I'm raising support for an <span class="highlight">eleven-month internship</span> in Nagoya, Japan, where I will work as a <span class="highlight">teaching assistant</span> in Nagoya Christian School from <span class="highlight">August 2026 - July 2027</span>. I believe God is calling me to serve the missionaries in Nagoya by <span class="highlight">helping to teach their children</span>, and to help <span class="highlight">share the Gospel</span> with the Japanese people who need Him so desperately. I would love for you to be part of this mission, by <span class="highlight">praying for me</span> and the mission and also, perhaps, through <span class="highlight">financial support</span>. Either way, I'm so glad you're here, and I'm so very excited for the opportunity to be a part of <span class="highlight">God's work in Japan</span>.
            </p>
